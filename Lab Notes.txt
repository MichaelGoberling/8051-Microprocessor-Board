Microprocessor Design Lab Notes: 

3/28: 	Switched from OrCAD to EAGLE in order to be able to work from home, etc.
	Colin Peterson provided crash course into EAGLE as well as documentation
	for learning more. 
	
	Created modules for the all memory, the power system, the address latch,
	reset circuitry, and the oscillator circuitry.
